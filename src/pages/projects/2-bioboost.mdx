## Purpose and Goal

I built this project because I wanted a platform that offered both productivity, and health tools. Ultimetaly I wanted an app to help keep people on track of their goals and keep people fit and healthy. To increase the number of days that you feel great. Increase the number of days where you are ectreamly productive and your work feels effortless.

This app is very far from being finished. I have a whole [list of features](https://github.com/raymondkneipp/bioboost-app#roadmap) I would like to add to it. Eventually I would like to be able to record a plethera of different health metrics.

A while ago I built a similar [app using the MERN stack called Routinely](https://github.com/raymondkneipp/Routinely).

## Problems and Thought Process

The trickiest part of the app was creating a calendar that shows users what days they were successful in a given activity. It required using many different array methods such as `some` and `every` to determine wether a task was completed for a given day. I also had to check to see if the task was created before that day or if the day is in the future. Using this information it would determine where the task was completed, was not completed, or no tasks were created yet so no need to display any info for that day.

## Lessons Learned

Before this project I would reach for an npm package called `variant-classnames`. This package would conditinally add class names to your componetns based on props. This removed the need to fill your className attributes with a bunch of ternary operators. For this project I chose `class-variance-authority` or cva. With `variant-classnames`, you would have to create an interface for all your props. CVA offers the `VariantProps` helper to extract variant types so you no longer have to manually write out the types yourself.
