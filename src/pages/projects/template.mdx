# Introduction

- High-level summary of the project
- List the core functionalities / interesting features
- Your role in the project, what parts did you tackle? (design, development, etc.)
- Technologies used
- Link to live demo + source code (if applicable)

# Purpose and Goal

- Why did you build this project? Why is it important to you?
- What was the expected outcome of the project?
- What were the initial designs?
- Any other preliminary planning that you did which helps build a narrative

# Spotlight

- What is the "killer feature" of your project? What feature does it have that took the most work or was the most technically impressive? Some possible examples:
  - User authentication
  - A feed of items fetched from a database
  - A particularly tricky UI element (eg. autocomplete, calendar, drag-and-drop)
  - Anything you are proud of!
- What were the technical hurdles that got in your way? Any major problems you hit during development?
- How did you solve those problems? What was the solution? Go deep here, and write with a developer in mind.

# Current Status

- This section is optional.
- If the project is actively being used by people, talk a little bit about the current status, who uses it, why they use it, what they say to you about it, and stuff like that.
- If the project was contrived specifically for the portfolio, omit this section.

# Lessons Learned

- What did you learn doing this project? Feel free to list multiple things. Also, feel free to cover non-technical lessons, It's great to talk about how you learned to use an advanced feature of a framework of a library, but it's just as valuable to talk about the project-management experience or things you learned about shipping projects.
- If you used a framework of other libraries/tools, was it a good choice? How did it help? In which ways was it insufficient?
- Is your project accessible? What did you learn about accessibility, while building this project? Describing how you tested your project using keyboard navigation or a screen reader can make for a compelling story!
- How has this affected the work you've done since then? Real examples of how this project built your knowledge for future projects are fantastic.

# Other

- Weave images in where they seem to fit.
- Good headings for bite-sized chunks of info
- Possible video demo
