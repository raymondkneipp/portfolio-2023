## Purpose and Goal

I created this project because the Murph workout is one of my favorites. I find this workout very challenging and rewarding. I wanted an easier way to record my completion times and keep track of the number of repetitions I have completed. Previously I would open my notes app and write down all the exercises and the number of repetitions I have performed.

## Problems

I did not run into any significant problems developing this site. I had created this [project before using the MERN stack](https://github.com/raymondkneipp/Murph-MERN), so I had a good idea of how it worked.

## Lessons Learned

Probably the most fun part of working on this app was the timer. I used a library called `luxon` to handle the starting and ending times for the three events. The timer UI utilized `setInterval` and a `useEffect` to update the time shown to the user.
